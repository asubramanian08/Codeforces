## Codeforces

I started doing [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) with AlphaStar-Ada in the beginning of 8th grade as a source of practice problems. Now I love participating in contests (handel [arjunsubramanian](https://codeforces.com/profile/arjunsubramanian) and increasing the rating.

This repos, simmilar to my [USACO](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO) repos has my solutions code or a .txt file that indicates where my solution to a problem is. It is divided by contest number and each file in a contest is named by the problem letter that it is. PS, navigate to a codeforces problem by "https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/(contest)/(problem)".
