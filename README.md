## Codeforces

I started doing [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) with [AlphaStar-Ada](https://github.com/asubramanian08/AlphaStar-Ada) in the beginning of 8th grade as a source of practice problems. Now I love participating in contests (handel [arjunsubramanian](https://codeforces.com/profile/arjunsubramanian)) and increasing my rating.

This repos, similar to my [USACO](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO) repos has my solutions code or a .txt file that indicates where my solution to a problem is. It is divided by contest number and each file in a contest is named by the problem letter that it is. PS, navigate to a [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) problem by "https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/(contest)/(problem)". If a folder have a G in front of the name it is from a Gym. You can navigate to those problems with "https://codeforces.com/gym/(contest)/problem/(problem)".

On official contests - ones I have taken during the contest time I will write " official: " on every problem and note the result:
* Correct: all test cases past
* Unattempted: Didn't submit anything
* Incorrect - Test case x: Failed on test case x
